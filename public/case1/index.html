                        <h2>Company Travel Budget Manager // UI Design & IA</h2>
                        <h3>Introduction.</h3>
                        <p>This case study presents your approach to a design challenge for a Company Travel Budget Manager. The challenge involved reviewing the existing information architecture of a platform designed to manage employee travel budgets, import different rules, define various levels of authorization, and incorporate city-specific budgets. The target users included managers and VP of finance who needed to oversee and control travel expenses. The solution focused on redesigning the information architecture, implementing a multi-step form for first-time login, and designing an intuitive dashboard to provide valuable statistics.</p>
                        <h3>Project Overview.</h3>
                        <p>The goal of the project was to design a comprehensive UI for the Company Travel Budget Manager platform. The platform targeted managers and VP of finance, enabling them to efficiently manage travel budgets, import employees and approvers, define levels of authorization, and incorporate city-specific budgets. The design solution included reviewing and enhancing the information architecture, developing a multi-step form for first-time login, and designing an intuitive dashboard for statistical analysis.</p>
                        <h3>Research and Discovery.</h3>
                        <p>To gain valuable insights into user needs and pain points, thorough research and analysis were conducted. The research phase involved understanding the requirements of managers and VP of finance involved in travel budget management. This research helped identify areas of improvement within the existing platform and provided a foundation for the design decisions.</p>
                        <h3>Design Process.</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Information Architecture Review:</strong> The first step involved reviewing the existing information architecture. Based on the research findings, you restructured the platform to better accommodate the needs of users. This included refining the hierarchy of authorization levels, creating a seamless process for importing employees and approvers, and integrating city-specific budgets.</li>
                            <li><strong>First-Time Login Multi-Step Form:</strong> To simplify the onboarding process, a multi-step form was designed for the first-time login experience. This form provided users with a guided process to import employees and approvers, utilizing methods such as CSV file import or integration with Gmail. The multi-step approach ensured a smooth and intuitive onboarding experience, reducing user confusion and setup time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dashboard Design:</strong> A crucial component of the platform was the dashboard, which provided users with access to valuable travel budget statistics. The dashboard design focused on presenting key metrics, expense breakdowns, and budget utilization in a clear and concise manner. Interactive elements, such as filters and sorting options, were incorporated to allow users to customize the data view according to their specific requirements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Integration with Notification Stream Services:</strong> Recognizing the importance of seamless communication, the platform was designed to integrate with notification stream services such as Slack or Discord. This integration enabled users to receive real-time updates and notifications regarding travel budget approvals, policy changes, or other relevant information. This feature enhanced collaboration and ensured timely communication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Outcome and Impact.</h3>
                        <p>The final UI design for the Travel Budget Manager platform yielded significant positive outcomes and impacts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enhanced Efficiency: The redesigned information architecture streamlined budget management, enabling managers and VP of finance to easily import employees and approvers, define authorization levels, and incorporate city-specific budgets. This resulted in increased efficiency and improved budget oversight.</li>
                            <li>Seamless Onboarding: The implementation of the multi-step form for first-time login simplified the onboarding process. Users could effortlessly import employees and approvers, minimizing setup time and reducing user confusion during initial platform usage.</li>
                            <li>Valuable Statistical Insights: The intuitive dashboard provided managers and VP of finance with valuable travel budget statistics. Key metrics, expense breakdowns, and budget utilization were presented in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enhancing budget control.</li>
                            <li>Efficient Communication: The integration with notification stream services enabled real-time updates and notifications, ensuring efficient communication among users involved in travel budget management. This feature promoted collaboration and timely decision-making.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion.</h3>
                        <p>This case study demonstrates your successful implementation of a UI design project for a Company Travel Budget Manager platform.
