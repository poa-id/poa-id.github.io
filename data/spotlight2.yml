title : "Contractor UI Design work"

  I've worked as a contractor designing UI for a B2B Insurance Broker company, and an event staffing platform. 
  <br>
  In both cases, the process had already started and I was hired to take their existing designs further, organizing and creating styleguides, while bringing good practices to their Figma files. The end result was beautiful UI, with great usability.
